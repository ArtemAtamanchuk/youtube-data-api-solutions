This solution allows you to get data about all **published** videos on a YouTube channel. To do this, you need `DEVELOPER_KEY` to assign the API key received in [Google Developers Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Assign `the channel_id` variable to the channel id from which you will receive video data.

To get the channel id you can go to the main page of the channel, e. g., [https://www.youtube.com/@GoogleDevelopers](https://www.youtube.com/@GoogleDevelopers). After that, open the source code of this page (normally, it is a `Ctrl` + `U` keys combination). There, open a search tool on the page (`Ctrl` + `F`) and paste `<link rel="canonical"`. After that, you find a single match, which is a `link` tag with the `href` attribute containing the YouTube channel link at the end of which is its id. In our case, we have `<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw">`: the `UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw` combination is the Google for Developers channel id.

Of course, you can do all of this through a variety of web applications, such as [https://ytubetool.com/tools/youtube-channel-id](https://ytubetool.com/tools/youtube-channel-id).

It is all: you don't need to do something. Run the script and you will get csv file (its name is `list_videos.csv`) wich has titles, URLs, and publish dates of all the videos of the channel. These items will be listed in order from oldest to newest.
