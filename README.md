# Getting Started
Each folder in this repository is a separate solution for a given problem (what is a problem is a separate issue). So for information on the solution to a particular problem, go to the appropriate folder and find its README.

Since the solutions are posted for YouTube Data API (v3), you can go [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).
